# Firebender Rules for Spirituum Project

## Development Approach
- Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) for all features
- Write tests first, then implement the necessary code
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Always run a Gradle sync after making updates to Gradle files and fix errors or notify the user before moving on

## Project Scope
- No authentication or user management features in current scope
- Focus solely on recipe management functionality

## Architecture Guidelines
- Maintain strict separation between UI, Domain, and Data layers
- Repository pattern for data access
- Use cases for business logic
- ViewModels for UI state management

## Code Style
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Include meaningful docstrings for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests should not share state
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing
- Test business logic thoroughly
- Include UI tests for critical user flows
- Platform-specific tests should be in their respective source sets (androidTest, etc.)
- Common tests should use platform-agnostic approaches when possible
- Use proper coroutine testing techniques:
  - TestScope with UnconfinedTestDispatcher for controlling coroutine execution
  - Use advanceUntilIdle() to ensure all coroutines complete before assertions
  - Set up Main dispatcher in tests with setMain and resetMain
  - Follow camelCase naming for test functions (not backtick-enclosed names)

## Running Tests
- Run ViewModel tests with: `./gradlew :composeApp:jvmTest --tests "com.josephhopson.sprituum.ui.package.ClassNameTest"`
- Run multiple tests in a package: `./gradlew :composeApp:jvmTest --tests "com.josephhopson.sprituum.ui.package.*"`
- Run all tests: `./gradlew :composeApp:allTests` (includes Android and iOS tests which may fail differently)
- UI Component tests using `runComposeUiTest` currently fail with NullPointerException and need additional configuration
- Focus testing efforts on ViewModelTests and ScreenTests as they provide the best coverage for business logic
- The `--tests` flag works only with the jvmTest task, not with Android or iOS test tasks

## Cross-Platform Guidelines
- Implement platform-specific dependencies via interface abstractions
- Register platform-specific implementations in the platform's dependency injection module
- Use expect/actual for platform-specific code
- Platform-specific code should be isolated in dedicated files
- Navigation can be implemented without heavyweight libraries for simple use cases

## Room Multiplatform Guidelines
- Use Room version 2.7.0-rc03 or newer for Kotlin Multiplatform support
- Android platform should use traditional Room initialization with context
- JVM platform should use BundledSQLiteDriver
- Ensure all DAOs use suspend functions or Flow returns for KMP compatibility
