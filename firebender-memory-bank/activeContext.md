# Active Context

## Recent Updates
- Removed authentication and user management requirements from the project scope
- Updated implementation plan to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Reorganized development phases to prioritize test creation before implementation
- Started Phase 1.1: Project Initialization - Setting up layer-first structure
- Implemented basic structure for data, domain, and ui layers
- Created initial models and repository interfaces
- Set up dependency injection with Koin
- Created test doubles for repositories
- Completed Phase 1.1 and started Phase 2: Data Layer TDD
- Researched Room with Kotlin Multiplatform implementation strategies
- Updated DAOs to be KMP compatible (suspend functions or Flow returns)
- Implemented Android-specific database initialization
- Created comprehensive test coverage for Room implementation
- Verified all data layer tests are passing successfully
- Decided to focus on completing Phase 2 on Android platform first, deferring iOS/Desktop database implementation
- Successfully implemented and tested UserPreferencesRepository for storing user preferences
- Added platform-specific Settings providers for Android and JVM
- Completed all four parts of Phase 2 with Android-focused implementations
- Completed Phase 3.1: Domain Layer use case implementation
- Implemented all core recipe management use cases (CRUD, search, filtering)
- Created comprehensive test suite for all use cases
- Reorganized project to move image handling to Phase 5.5
- Completed Phase 4.1: ViewModel testing setup
- Created ViewModelTest base class for handling coroutines in tests
- Implemented RecipeListViewModel with state management
- Created comprehensive UI state models and events
- Added preference management use cases

## Current Focus
- Moving to Phase 4.2: Composable Testing
- Setting up UI testing utilities for Compose
- Planning for screenshot testing of key components
- Designing accessibility test cases
- iOS/Desktop implementations deferred until core functionality is complete

## Key Decisions
- Adopting TDD methodology throughout the project
- Focusing solely on recipe management features
- Following layer-first architecture with UI, Domain, and Data layers
- Using Material 3 for consistent visual design
- Using Koin for dependency injection
- Room database will be set up differently for each platform:
  - Android will use traditional Room database builder with context
  - iOS/Desktop will use SQLite drivers with the newer Room KMP API (deferred until after Phase 2)
- Prioritizing Android implementation while ensuring architecture remains cross-platform compatible
