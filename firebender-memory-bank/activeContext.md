  - Custom navigation system for all platforms
  - Platform-specific sharing implementations (Android, iOS, Desktop)
  - Full test coverage with fixed coroutine handling
  - Fixed RecipeListViewModelTest issues by improving coroutine test handling
- Made significant progress on Phase 5.3: Recipe Creation & Editing:
  - Implemented RecipeEditUiState and RecipeEditUiEvent for state management
  - Created RecipeEditViewModel with comprehensive functionality
  - Implemented individual form components (BasicInfoSection, IngredientsSection, InstructionsSection, TagsSection)
  - Created main RecipeEditScreen that combines all components
  - Added error handling and validation logic
  - Implemented two-way data binding with the ViewModel
  - Added accessibility annotations to all form components
  - Created initial image handling UI (placeholder implementation)
  - Wrote comprehensive tests for RecipeEditViewModel and RecipeEditScreen
  - Recorded proper test running commands in the firebenderrules.md file
- Fixed critical navigation issues:
  - Integrated RecipeEditScreen into the app's navigation system
  - Connected the "Create Recipe" buttons in the RecipeListScreen to navigate to RecipeEditScreen
  - Implemented navigation from RecipeDetailScreen to RecipeEditScreen for editing
  - Added proper back navigation handling to return to appropriate screens
- Fixed layout issues in RecipeEditScreen:
  - Fixed nested scrollable components issue in IngredientsSection and InstructionsSection
  - Replaced LazyColumn with regular Column to avoid conflicts with parent verticalScroll
  - Ensured form components work correctly within the scrollable container
- Implemented starter recipes system:
  - Created InitialRecipesProvider interface and JsonInitialRecipesProvider implementation
  - Designed and added 10 high-quality ancestral cocktail recipes in JSON format
  - Implemented expect/actual pattern for platform-specific resource loading
  - Created InitializeAppDataUseCase to populate the database on first launch
  - Enhanced UserPreferencesRepository to track first launch status
  - Integrated recipe initialization at app startup
  - Added comprehensive tests for the initialization system
  - Documented expect/actual pattern in techContext.md
- Fixed cross-platform resource loading in Android:
  - Updated the Android assets configuration in build.gradle.kts to include common resources
  - Improved resource loading to correctly find recipe files in the assets directory
  - Ensured all platforms load the same resources from a single source of truth
- Implemented proper logging with Kermit:
  - Replaced all println() calls with structured logging using Kermit
  - Added appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
  - Added documentation on proper logging practices to firebenderrules.md
- Improved UI styling and visual appeal:
  - Enhanced Material 3 theme with refined color palette and custom typography
  - Added animations for better user feedback and visual appeal
  - Created improved cards with gradients, shadows, and better visual hierarchy
  - Updated form components with consistent styling and better visual structure

## Current Focus
- Complete remaining Phase 5.3 tasks:
  - Implementing image capture functionality for recipe photos
  - Creating rich text editor integration for about and notes fields
  - Fixing UI component tests that currently fail with NullPointerExceptions
- Moving towards Phase 5.4: Search & Filtering UI

## Key Decisions
- Adopting TDD methodology throughout the project
- Focusing solely on recipe management features
- Following layer-first architecture with UI, Domain, and Data layers
- Using Material 3 for consistent visual design
- Using Koin for dependency injection
- Room database setup for each platform:
  - Android uses traditional Room database builder with context
  - JVM/Desktop uses BundledSQLiteDriver with Room builder
  - iOS implementation will use platform-specific SQLite drivers (deferred)
- Ensuring cross-platform component tests use platform-agnostic approaches
- Using a simple custom navigation system instead of a complex library
- Implementing platform-specific sharing functionality with a unified interface
- Using simplified placeholder for image handling in RecipeEditScreen until proper implementation
- Avoiding nested scrollable components in Compose UI to prevent layout conflicts
