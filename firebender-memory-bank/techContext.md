## Doc Comments
- Document code elements such as classes, methods, functions, and variables
- Include concise summaries and avoid redundancy with surrounding context
- Use examples and explanations for parameters, return values, and exceptions where helpful

## Kotlin Multiplatform expect/actual Pattern
- Use `expect` declarations in commonMain for platform-specific functionality
- Provide corresponding `actual` implementations in each platform's source set (androidMain, jvmMain, iosMain)
- All platforms the app targets must have an actual implementation
- Common errors:
  - "Expected function has no actual declaration in module" - Missing implementation in one or more platforms
  - "Modifier 'expect' is not applicable to 'member function'" - expect can't be used on class members; move it outside
- Platform-specific implementations must be in the correct source set directory structure:
  - Android: composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/[package path]
  - JVM: composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/[package path]
  - iOS: composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin/[package path]
- Always maintain identical package structure across platforms for expect/actual declarations

## Testing
- create Unit tests for business logic classes
    - Tests should not share state.
- Use `androidTest` source set for instrumented tests of Room database
- Use `androidx.room:room-testing` library for testing migrations
- Create an in-memory database for testing:

## Room KMP Implementation Notes
- Room for Kotlin Multiplatform is relatively new (introduced in version 2.7.0-alpha01 on May 1, 2024)
- Current version (2.7.0-rc03) supports Android, iOS, JVM (Desktop), native Mac and native Linux platforms
- Key implementation differences from standard Android Room:
  - Android platform uses traditional database builder with context
  - Other platforms use SQLite drivers with new Room KMP APIs
  - KMP version requires DAO functions to be either suspend functions or return Flow
- Platform-specific initialization:
  - Android: Use `Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, "db-name").build()`
  - iOS/Other: Use `Room.databaseBuilder("db-name").setDriver(driver).build()`
