# Cocktail Recipe App UI Design

## Objective
Design a stunning and functional user interface (UI) for a cocktail recipe app using Material 3 guidelines. The app should cater to:
- Cocktail enthusiasts of all experience levels.
- Home bartenders who create and experiment with recipes.
- Professional bartenders looking for a personal recipe organization tool.
- Anyone who enjoys making and documenting cocktails.

The app must ensure accessibility, offline functionality, and compatibility across Android, iOS, and desktop platforms (Mac OS and Linux).

## Key Features to Incorporate

### 1. Recipe Browsing and Discovery
- Allow users to browse saved recipes with an intuitive layout.
- Include search functionality with filters (e.g., by ingredients, tags, or cocktail name).

### 2. Recipe Creation and Editing
- Enable users to create new recipes with rich text formatting (for "about," "instructions," and "notes").
- Allow users to add images (either by uploading pictures or generating them via AI in the future).
- Support editing existing recipes seamlessly.

### 3. Detailed Recipe View
- Display recipe information with a mix of text and imagery.
- Ensure text is visually prominent and easy to read.

### 4. Accessibility
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers.
- Include options for font size adjustments for low-vision users.
- Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast and avoid using color alone to communicate state.

### 5. Offline-First Functionality
- Design the app to work offline by default while syncing data when online.

### 6. Device Compatibility
- Optimize UI for mobile (portrait orientation) with bottom navigation.
- Adjust UI for desktop (landscape orientation) with a sidebar menu.

### 7. Light & Dark Mode
- Provide a toggle between light and dark modes.
- Use muted tones for both themes.

### 8. Animations & Transitions
- Integrate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience without overwhelming functionality.

## Design Guidelines

### 1. Material 3 Components
- Utilize Material 3 elements like navigation bars, cards, floating action buttons (FABs), etc., to ensure consistency across platforms.

### 2. Typography
- Use classic fonts that are readable yet elegant, emphasizing text as the primary focus of the app.

### 3. Color Palette
- Employ muted tones that create a sophisticated aesthetic while maintaining good readability.

### 4. Imagery and Text Balance
- Combine image-based elements (user-uploaded or AI-generated) with text-focused design that makes instructions and notes stand out.

## Additional Considerations

### 1. Navigation Suggestions
- **For mobile**: Bottom navigation bar for quick access to core features.
- **For desktop**: Sidebar menu for broader functionality while maximizing screen space.

### 2. Accessibility Enhancements
- Focus on inclusive design principles so all users can accomplish tasks regardless of physical ability or device limitations.

### 3. User Flow Optimization
- Ensure smooth transitions between browsing recipes, creating/editing recipes, and viewing detailed information.
