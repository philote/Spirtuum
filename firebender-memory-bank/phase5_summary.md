# Phase 5.1: Recipe List Management Implementation

## Components Created
- RecipeListScreen composable with:
  - Support for both list and grid view modes
  - Search functionality
  - Sorting and filtering options
  - Empty state handling
  - Loading and error states
  - Proper accessibility annotations

## Tests
- RecipeListScreenTest
  - Tests event handling in a platform-agnostic way
  - Validates navigation flow
  - Confirms all user events are properly processed

## Known Issues
- RecipeListViewModelTest was fixed to properly handle coroutines (previously failing)
- Implemented TestScope with UnconfinedTestDispatcher and advanceUntilIdle calls to ensure coroutines complete
  
## Next Steps
- Phase 5.3: Recipe Creation & Editing
  - Implement recipe creation and editing UI
  - Create form validation logic
  - Add image capture functionality

## Cross-Platform Fixes
- Fixed Koin initialization for desktop by adding it to main.kt
- Implemented JvmDatabaseProvider for desktop that uses BundledSQLiteDriver
- Added sqlite-bundled dependency for JVM target
- Fixed Android dependency injection to use AndroidPlatformModule with both:
  - AndroidDatabaseProvider - for database access
  - AndroidSettingsProvider - for settings access

## Lessons Learned
- In Kotlin Multiplatform, it's critical to ensure each platform has all required dependencies registered
- Platform-specific implementations should be grouped in platform modules for cleaner organization
- Test using platform-agnostic approaches when possible
- Use interface abstractions for all platform-specific functionality
- Properly manage coroutines in tests using TestScope and UnconfinedTestDispatcher
- Use advanceUntilIdle() to ensure coroutines complete before making assertions

# Phase 5.2: Recipe Detail Implementation

## Components Created
- RecipeDetailScreen composable with:
  - Detailed recipe information display
  - Actions (favorite, edit, delete, share, back navigation)
  - Error and loading states
  - Proper accessibility annotations
  - Well-organized sections for ingredients, instructions, and notes

- RecipeDetailViewModel with functionality for:
  - Loading recipe details
  - Managing UI state
  - Handling user actions
  - Navigation control
  - Sharing recipes

- Platform-specific sharing implementation:
  - Android: Intent-based sharing
  - iOS: UIActivityViewController
  - Desktop: Clipboard-based sharing

- Custom navigation system:
  - Simple NavController implementation
  - Screen-based routing
  - Back stack management

## Tests
- RecipeDetailViewModelTest
  - Tests the ViewModel's ability to load recipes
  - Verifies error handling for non-existent recipes
  - Tests favorite toggle functionality
  - Tests delete recipe functionality
  - Tests navigation events
  
- RecipeDetailScreenTest
  - Tests screen navigation event handling
  - Validates all user actions produce correct events
  - Tests event consumption

## Known Issues
- None - all tests are passing

## Next Steps
- Phase 5.3: Recipe Creation & Editing
  - Create UI for recipe form
  - Implement validation logic
  - Add ingredient and instruction management
  - Create rich text editor for appropriate fields

## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Platform-specific sharing implementations work on all target platforms
- Navigation system supports all platforms without external dependencies
- UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## Lessons Learned
- Platform-specific code should be isolated in dedicated files
- Navigation can be implemented without heavyweight libraries for simple use cases
- Tests need proper coroutine handling to avoid flakiness
- UI state management should be predictable and testable
