# Active Context

## Recent Updates
- Removed authentication and user management requirements from the project scope
- Updated implementation plan to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Reorganized development phases to prioritize test creation before implementation
- Started Phase 1.1: Project Initialization - Setting up layer-first structure
- Implemented basic structure for data, domain, and ui layers
- Created initial models and repository interfaces
- Set up dependency injection with Koin
- Created test doubles for repositories
- Completed Phase 1.1 and started Phase 2: Data Layer TDD
- Researched Room with Kotlin Multiplatform implementation strategies
- Updated DAOs to be KMP compatible (suspend functions or Flow returns)
- Implemented Android-specific database initialization
- Created comprehensive test coverage for Room implementation
- Verified all data layer tests are passing successfully
- Decided to focus on completing Phase 2 on Android platform first, deferring iOS/Desktop database implementation
- Successfully implemented and tested UserPreferencesRepository for storing user preferences
- Added platform-specific Settings providers for Android and JVM
- Completed all four parts of Phase 2 with Android-focused implementations
- Completed Phase 3.1: Domain Layer use case implementation
- Implemented all core recipe management use cases (CRUD, search, filtering)
- Created comprehensive test suite for all use cases
- Reorganized project to move image handling to Phase 5.5
- Completed Phase 4.1 (ViewModel Testing) and 4.2 (Composable Testing)
- Created UI component testing infrastructure with accessibility focus
- Implemented Material 3 app theme with light/dark mode support
- Created and tested core UI components (RecipeCard, FilterChip)
- Ensured accessibility features in all UI components
- Completed Phase 5.1: Recipe List Management with implementations for:
  - Recipe List/Grid view
  - Search functionality
  - Sorting and filtering
  - Empty state handling
- Fixed platform-specific issues in both JVM and Android targets:
  - Added Koin initialization in desktop main.kt
  - Implemented JvmDatabaseProvider for desktop platform
  - Fixed dependency injection in Android to use AndroidPlatformModule

## Current Focus
- Moving to Phase 5.2: Recipe Detail Implementation
- Implementing recipe detail screen
- Adding navigation between list and detail screens
- Creating use cases for recipe detail actions

## Key Decisions
- Adopting TDD methodology throughout the project
- Focusing solely on recipe management features
- Following layer-first architecture with UI, Domain, and Data layers
- Using Material 3 for consistent visual design
- Using Koin for dependency injection
- Room database setup for each platform:
  - Android uses traditional Room database builder with context
  - JVM/Desktop uses BundledSQLiteDriver with Room builder
  - iOS implementation will use platform-specific SQLite drivers (deferred)
- Ensuring cross-platform component tests use platform-agnostic approaches
