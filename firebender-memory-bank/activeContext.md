# Active Context

## Recent Updates
- Removed authentication and user management requirements from the project scope
- Updated implementation plan to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Reorganized development phases to prioritize test creation before implementation
- Started Phase 1.1: Project Initialization - Setting up layer-first structure
- Implemented basic structure for data, domain, and ui layers
- Created initial models and repository interfaces
- Set up dependency injection with Koin
- Created test doubles for repositories
- Completed Phase 1.1 and started Phase 2: Data Layer TDD
- Researched Room with Kotlin Multiplatform implementation strategies
- Updated DAOs to be KMP compatible (suspend functions or Flow returns)
- Implemented Android-specific database initialization
- Created comprehensive test coverage for Room implementation

## Current Focus
- Project is in Phase 2.1 - Recipe data model TDD
- Writing and running tests for Android Room implementation
- Planning for basic UI components implementation
- Deferring iOS database implementation until later

## Key Decisions
- Adopting TDD methodology throughout the project
- Focusing solely on recipe management features
- Following layer-first architecture with UI, Domain, and Data layers
- Using Material 3 for consistent visual design
- Using Koin for dependency injection
- Room database will be set up differently for each platform:
  - Android will use traditional Room database builder with context
  - iOS/Desktop will use SQLite drivers with the newer Room KMP API (deferred for now)
